## Vegim Qehaja

Natural born tinkerer and an experienced eCommerce individual. Adaptive to new situations and a keen problem solver. 


Self motivated, driven and dedicated, with experience running a small business and working with others in a start-up environment, as well as integrating into large groups in more established operations. Excellent at picking up new responsibilities and maintaining productivity due to having the innate thirst for learning required to acquire new skills and the perseverance to be continually improving. 

Having spent a year or two self-learning with Arduino and Raspberry Pi I realised how much I loved coding and decided to jump into this field of work head first by pursuing a career in programming.

Recently graduated from Makers Academy, Europes leading coding boot camp and now looking to take on more responsibility as a junior level developer to build on my passion for programming and problem solving, challenging myself daily to further my journey from junior to craftsmen by learning from the ground up and putting my new found skills to use.

## Skills

Programming -  A Firm grasp of OOP, MVC and SOLID concepts. Following best practices and agile methodologies my coding idols are Robert Martin, Ken Beck, Sandi Metz and Martin Fowler. I regularly imbibe videos and books produced by these code giants applying the insight they provide into well-tested programming principles.  

Language Agnostic - Personally I am not attached to any one particular programming language. Every tool has its use and each one has its own inflexion, I enjoy finding the similarities and disparities between different languages and the paradigms that are inherent to them. Therefore, I don't mind which language I use and can adapt easily to new tech contexts with minimal training.

Problem Solving - The stuff of life, You can't get away from problems in the real world and in the world of programming it is much the same. It's what you learn from the problem at hand that matters. You are always being taught something and this facet of programming feeds my interest the most. The problems are so varied and multiplex and this keeps me fired up and hungry to learn more - no problem or program is ever exactly the same. 

TDD/BDD - Red, Green, Refactor. With the problem defined, BDD and TDD help break down a specification into its smaller parts, aiding me in my effort to write code that is relevant and less verbose. Furthermore, it gives others greater confidence when diving into a particular codebase and make changes (especially as program complexity increases). This lessened the dependencies on comments clutter the codebase you since a good test suite acts as self-validating documentation for yourself and others.

Research/Curiosity - When confronted with a problem, I like to weigh up the possibilities and consider the opportunity cost involved with each decision before I make the leap. Standing on the shoulders of giants and building on the work of others can be very useful in informing what design decisions to make with a given problem set.

Pair-Programming - Two heads are better than one (most of the time) - working in a pair effectively can speed up development and reduce errors when done properly. The sum is truly greater than its parts when teams work well together. The amount of learning through this osmotic process of pairing daily at Makers Academy from day one has greatly aided my learning and understanding of best practices.

Agile - Farewell to Waterfall. Agile methodologies help keep a project relevant and on time.  I respect the aims and intentions of agile processes. Short iterations help identify any issues early on in the project in turn helping produce more accurate and concise solutions to a problem. My time at makers helped me understand the value of agile processes through daily intra and inter team standups and code-reviews.

## Interests

Hacking - Arduino and raspberry pis - regularly jumping into ad-hoc projects using servos , motors , pumps etc. Fascinated by creating semi-autonomous systems that manage themselves using an array of sensors - my home is strewn with the remnants of Frankenstein projects (much to the chagrin of my partner).

Permaculture - Love everything to do with plants - the environment and sustainability, permaculture is a system designed to work with the ecosystem rather than against it.

Reading - Avid reader/researcher - often to be found burning the midnight oil traversing weird and wonderful ideas and concepts

Music - Enjoy many different musical styles and worked as promoter and organiser of house and techno nights whilst occasionally venturing out to play pounding electronic music to overly inebriated youths at friends club nights.
